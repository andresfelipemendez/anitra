# Anitra Engine

A data-oriented game engine built with C++ 20, Imgui and GLFW.


![Hot reloading demo](hotreloadingdemo.gif)

## Overview

Anitra Engine is designed with performance and flexibility in mind, utilizing data-oriented design principles to create an efficient and scalable architecture. Built using C++ 20 and GLFW for cross-platform window management and input handling.

## Features

Current features:
- Data-oriented architecture for optimal performance
- Cross-platform support via GLFW
- Modern OpenGL rendering
- Entity-component system
- DLL hot reloading

Planned features:
- ImGui integration for debug UI and tools
- glTF support for 3D model loading
- STB libraries integration for image loading and data structure containers
- Expanded hot reloading capabilities

## Prerequisites

- CMake (version 3.12 or higher)
- Visual Studio 2022

## Building

This project uses CMake as its build system. To build the project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```batch
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anitra-engine.git
    ```

2. Generate the project files:

    ```batch
    cd anitra-engine
    ./generate.bat
    ```

3. Build the project:

    ```batch
    ./build.bat
    ```

## Project Structure
this is at a high level the design that I have in mind for the engine
